# PHP-E-Commerce-Website
This project is a Customer-to-Customer (C2C) marketplace website. It allows users to buy and sell items, request deliveries, and communicate in real time, while drivers handle deliveries and admins manage the entire system.  The system is built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with role-based dashboards for Users, Drivers, and Admins.
